 # Project Brief Template

When creating a project brief, follow this structured format to ensure clarity and completeness:

## Title
- Use a descriptive, concise title: "[Project Name]: Project Brief"

## Introduction
- Begin with a one-sentence mission statement in **bold**
- Provide a brief overview (2-3 sentences) of the purpose and value of the system/project

## Core Components/Features
- List the main components or key features using bullet points
- Use *italics* for emphasizing important concepts
- For each significant component, include:
  - Its purpose
  - How it relates to other components
  - Any unique characteristics

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use clear headings for different sections
- Highlight important points using **bold** text
- Distinguish between mandatory requirements and optional enhancements
- Use paragraphs with topic sentences for improved readability
- Connect concepts using phrases like "Think of it this way..." for analogies

## Documentation Structure
- Keep paragraphs focused on a single topic (3-5 sentences max)
- Utilize formatting consistently: headings, lists, bold, italics
- Create a logical flow of information, from overview to details
- Include a "Key Points" section to highlight crucial information

## Visual Formatting
- Maintain consistent heading levels (# for main title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)
- Use bullet points (*) for lists of related items
- Apply indentation consistently for nested information
- Create visual separation between major sections with blank lines

Remember that a good project brief not only explains WHAT the project is, but also WHY certain decisions were made and HOW components work together to achieve the overall goal.
